# Hello, world!

---

export const val = useInputByKey('hello-content')
export const path = 'hello'

Write a hello file with "{val}".

<Input
  type="text"
  label="Content"
  key="hello-content"
/>

<File path={path} content={val} />

---

That's it, we did it! We wrote "{val}" to <code>{path}</code>!
